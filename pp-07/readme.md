# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742478.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Will use small sentences and make sure text is as large and simple as possible.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742479.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:Website is divided into two simple columns on desktop version, or one longer column on mobile (or smaller screen). Elements will scale with screen size as to to remain legible on multiple screen sizes. A menu is used to remove some clutter from the main screen that would not likely be relevant to users.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742463.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Similar to the other two guidelines, the design was created to be easily usable on touch devices, pen devices, and well as standard keyboard devices.
