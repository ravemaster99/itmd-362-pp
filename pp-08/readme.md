# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:This object is comfortable to use. It feel good to hold. Its easy to see from a distance. The black and white contrast well. The band feels like security; privacy.

* Behavioral:It sticks closed well enough, but is easily openable for use. The outside s sturdy, simple without flash or flair. The band is simple enough to keep it shut, but not rugged or hearty to look imposing

* Reflective:This book looks mature. It looks like something professional and business standard. Its comfortable to look at and use while being effieicent at whaat it does (takes notes). Its sleek and rounded for an organic, natural look. Properties of futurism.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1.Comfortable to use. Probably would translate to not having too many menus or useless options.
2.A simplicity in design. A site that works and can get you where you need and do what you need without wasted words.
3.Mature and professional. A site design that doesnt rely on flashy colours or graphics
