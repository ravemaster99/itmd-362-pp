# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1.Website loads in 3 seconds
2.Custom page for pages not found (error catching)

4.Are the important pages immediately visible
5.Is contact information easily accessible
6.Important things are asy to scan for
7.Layout is consistent
8.Media (flash, videos, etc) are used sparingly
