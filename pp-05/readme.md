## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53z0k0khwnzb8bsfsivjYrOlVw2
Your Rationale: I chose blue colours, with a slight tint to have a pleasant appearance with a bit of darkness. While oranges and browns usually compliment furniture in a house better, blue is still a nice colour to a room's atmosphere. As for a gaming console, the sloid level of blue is related to the idea that player one in a game is usually red or blue.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32U170kjglMa+2-ewbzmYulqTRl
Your Rationale:Spring colours are representing the the renewal of nature and warmth after a winter. The palette uses a heavier tint, because flora tends to start off a bit pale before coming into their full colour towards summer.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=53i1o0km5mAkEaYlngKmws3mW-w
Your Rationale: This palette features yellow, blue and purple, as well an an emphasis on tone, rather than strong black or white. The colours are meant to feel both bright with the yellow, and grounded with the purple, with green as the base color. The contrasted purple and yellow also represent both power and luxury, to give a sense of higher quality.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=10a1d0kgFKoSLVLpkKa6gS70iRC
Your Rationale: I chose a red as the primary colour, simply because rubies are red. The other features of the site would be darkr, more stabnd-out read. Text would be black, which is why the tint is so high, so as to let the text be more visible.
